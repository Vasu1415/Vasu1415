# Hi there! 👋

## About Me 😁

👋 Hi there! I'm Vasu Mittal, a Computer Science senior at the University of Maryland, College Park, graduating soon and pursuing my master's right after! I’m an aspiring software engineer passionate about Machine Learning, Full-Stack Development, and AI applications. I love solving real-world problems and building impactful solutions.

🎓 As a researcher, I’m currently working on **crowd simulation-based projects** and exploring agent behaviors and predictive models. I’ve also worked on projects related to **plant disease detection** and **AI-driven systems**, contributing to advancements in their respective domains.

👔 I’ve also mentored students at **Technica**, the world’s largest hackathon for underrepresented genders in tech, providing guidance and technical support. Additionally, I’m passionate about **teaching**, having TA’d for several classes at UMD.

✅ Recently, I built several impactful projects like:
- 🎮 The **Higher or Lower Game**, integrating the RAWG.io API and secure user authentication.
- 💻 An **Interactive Web Code Editor** with real-time execution and AI chatbot features.
- 🎵 A **Deep Learning-Based Music Generator**, leveraging spectrograms and CNNs to analyze and synthesize similar songs.
